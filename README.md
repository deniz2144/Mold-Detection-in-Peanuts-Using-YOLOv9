# Mold Detection in Peanuts Using YOLOv9
 Mold Detection in Peanuts Using YOLOv9: 99.99% Accuracy!
I have developed a system using the YOLOv9 algorithm to detect mold in peanuts. This system will make quality control in peanut production processes much faster and more reliable.

üîç Project Features:

Algorithm: YOLOv9
Detection Type: Moldy vs. non-moldy peanuts
Accuracy: 99.99%
üí° Why Is This Important?
Detecting mold in agricultural products like peanuts is crucial for both producers and consumers. Moldy products can pose health risks and lead to economic losses. With this highly accurate detection system, it's possible to ensure that healthy products reach the market while reducing costs for producers.
